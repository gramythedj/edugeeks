Curious scientists had a thought of what is the smallest particle that everything is made up of. ancient Greeks considered atom as the undivisible parcle from which everything is made. Many enthusiats who were not satisfied with that answer have worked and found out that an atom can be furthur divided and found the existence of new particles which were unknown before and named them as "Electrons" and "protons". they were showing a behaviour unlike any other body that is they used to attract or repel. based on the scientists have researched and found that it is because of the intrinsic property of the particles. and that property was named as charge

Charge is responsible for the behaviour of attraction and repulsions of sub-atomic particles.
