## Why did such huge trade appear between India and Rome?

-   Major reason was the diversion of silk route as it passed from India
    
-   Sea route → deccan/south → Arabian Sea → Red Sea →Mediterranean Sea → Egypt (alexandria port) → Europe(Italy)
    
-   Roman emperor Augustus and his commander - Mark Antony invaded Egypt and won the battle and later married the Queen Cleopatra
    
-   At that time Egypt was full of Arabs(NOT Muslims) and they are Sea lovers at the same time Roman merchant called HIPPALUS learned the knowledge of sea routes from Arabs
    
-   Directional of Seasonal Winds(monsoons) discovered by Hippalaus which helped traders to back and forth from India and Europe
    

  

Note: in Tamil Nadu Muzuris village, there's a temple of Augustus Built by Romans

  

In Amaravati there's a separate colony of romans

  

-   Technology developed for building highways and ringwells, so guilds became more active.
    

  
  

## Imports and Exports:

  
  


| Imports    | Exports                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Perfumes   | Spices (pepper)                      |
| Few Metals | Cotton (Muslins) and Silk from china |
| slaves     | Ivory Products                       |
| Gold       | Pearls                               |

  
  

India is the hub of Natural Resources and became the master of Exports and has favorable balance of trade, or a trade surplus

  
  
  

Religion During the Sangam Period or post Mauryan Period?
