Note: there is no state until Magadha emerged as it follows the koutilya's definition of state called Saptangas

  
  

Features of **Saptangas** (very important)

  

1.  Amatyas(Ministers)
    
2.  Friends (ally kingdoms)
    
3.  Swamy(Ruler)
    
4.  Dauthya (diplomats)
    
5.  Danda (Judiciary)
    
6.  Jana (people , considerable population)
    
7.  Durga( Fortified Capital)
    

  
  
  
  

## Why Magadha is Powerful?

1.  First advantageous is Geographical advantage, full of Resources like Iron mines and fortified Capitals, had full of Forests covers
    

-   Major advantage is Elephants and Timber(weapons) from Forests Reserves
    
-   Some weapons names Rathamusala and Mahasilakantaka(both were shown in the Bahubali movie were originally used in Magadha empire
    

  

2.  Magadha served by great Intellectuals like [Jeevaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C4%ABvaka) (first Doctor in India), Koutilya also called as [Chanakya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanakya) also known as vishnugupta who wrote the Greatest masterpiece treatise on statecraft, political science, economic policy and military strategy called Arthashastra
    

Another intellectual is Rakshasa(greatest diplomat)

Pingalaka (spy)

Assakara (senapati of Ajatashatru)

3.  All Magadha Rulers are monarchs, so there is continuity of policies
    

  
  
  

## Why couldn't Magadha capture Gandhara and Kamboja?

  

-   One of many reasons was Geographical distance and Iran (Persian kingdoms at that time were very powerful under [Darius-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_the_Great))
    
-   Later Greece invaded and the Kingdom of Ambi(first Drhohi of India) invited Alexander to join his hands and defeat his local enemy.
    
-   326 BC battle of hydaspes on the banks of Jhelum Porus defeated Alexander(Indian Version, Greeks version is opposite), overall battle was neutral
    

  

Alexander defeated small indian kingdoms upto Ravi river and stayed there for 18 months but didn't enter India because he Feared Ruler of Magadha Dhanananda as he was having 6000 Mighty elephants and 9000 infantry(horses) and 100,000 + soldiers

  
  

But the Greek's answer is different, as Herodotus said that Greek soldiers were exhausted and felt homesick.
