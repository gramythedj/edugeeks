-   Buddha used to say he is not god and never construct Idols
    
-   They follow Ashtanga Marga for salvation
    
-   Popularly spreads to Srilanka and other south east Asian countries
    
-   Wrote only in the Pali language
    

  

Important Pali text- **Milindapanho**

  
  

**Mahayana Buddhism**(Greater Vehicle)

  

-   Became more popular and Pro chargers
    
-   Adopted Sanskrit Language and became popular in the 1st Century
    
-   Brahmanic became more powerful that's why sanskrit was adopted and Pali was getting old and rare
    
-   They believe Buddha is a God
    
-   A major reason for the downfall of Buddha as people celebrated buddha as God and Installed Idols and stupas
    
-   They believed Bodhisattva will give the salvation to all

-   Buddhism competed with Brahmanism and lost its identity
    
-   Superstition beliefs in ‘Buddhism(Kalachakra and Sahajayana)
    
-   No King after 1st century AD patronised Buddhism

These are all internal reasons for the decline of Buddhism and External reason was Islamic Invasion(example Bakhtiyar khilji)
