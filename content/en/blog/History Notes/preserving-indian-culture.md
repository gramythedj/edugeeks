India was home to a wide range of cultures. Many cultures and traditions were destroyed in the past centuries. But this trend didn't stop even after India became independent. Many many reasons for Indians to forget their cultures and customs and adopt new popular customs and some of them were necessary. Today Indian people are quite different from their ancestors a century ago, and the culture has changed significantly. 


Thanks to the internet, there is a new possibility to enhance the contemporary cultures in every corner of India. Today many YouTubers are utilising the internet as a medium for a source of income in rural-urban and Cosmopolitan areas. Interesting progress is happening in the rural and urban areas.


In India, there is a wide range of diversity; every 10 kilometres, there would be changes in words of the same language and slight differences in food and customs. 100 km distance, a different accent of the same language with many alternative words for the same things to represent, and food culture would be noticeably different. At a distance of 500 km, there is a high possibility that you would encounter an entire change in food customs, culture, dressing style, and language. This is not something stupid you have done; it is natural for people to tend to make their customs and culture as time passes and develop new traditions.


Nowadays, the young YouTubers in every corner of the nation create content focusing on the views of that region, mainly focusing on that culture. There is a film industry in every language today in India, but the problem is these film industries are located in the capital cities of the states, and most of the content is related to that city or Indians in foreign cities. 


The audience can engage with these YouTubers because they use the jokes, the language of that region, and culture also plays a role. While the film industries represent the popular culture of that language belt, although it has responsibility for representing the language belt, in most cases, it represents the cultures of a single City. In minor situations, it returns to the culture of the belt other than the central city.


While these big film industries have developed through decades, the young YouTubers concentrated in the rural areas and every corner of the nation lack art-making skills, budget and encouragement. There will be more good content if we encourage them and support them with the proper art-making education in all parts of India. 
It is not a new thing in India. Before the age of film industries and TV entertainment, people's entertainment was theatres, dance forms, kacheries etc. They used to entertain the public, and also, they used to be the source of income for many artists in all locations. 
If we encourage these YouTubers and local online content creators, they would act like revivals of the old customs or encourage creating new meaningful traditions in their own culture.

## Advantages

**
The advantages of happening this change would be as follows:
* A large scale of employment opportunities would be created. In the film industries, a small group of people would be able to create content for crores of people. This resulted in only small dozens of leading content creators dominating the industry, creating many problems. But two issues are more crucial in our interest in this article. 

* One is a minimal workforce for producing content for a large population. And second is the concentration of employment in a single place, which centralises employment in big cities instead of diversifying.
*
*  So this new generation might create significant employment opportunities for many people in their local areas like artists(actors, singers, musicians, and other technical staff), art schools, and entertainment events. Srikanth Sriram, a YouTuber who started a channel called My Village Show in 2012, said that he began the channel mainly to create employment in his village. The channel gained a large audience, and due to that, many actors were introduced into the Telugu film industry, and one of them was an older woman of age above 60 who gained a large fan base.
* 
* More and more engaging, this system would connect to the people they want to watch in the movies. For example, the culture of Srikakulam, a district of Andhra Pradesh, didn't have the minimum importance in the Telugu film industry. While people of Srikakulam proudly say that they are Telugu speaking people whose accent is unique and beautiful. They would love to watch content in their accent, and they would like to watch content based on the lifestyle of people living there.

* Being diverse will create more options, and traditional filmmaking would create little possibilities where more and more people should concentrate on fewer and fewer art forms present there. If diversity is encouraged, people would have a chance to focus on an extensive range of opportunities.

* Art is the best way to address some problems which people are facing. It could represent the problems of that area which the regular film industries couldn't show. Srikakulam suffered from kidney diseases, and people were dying in large numbers.

 The Telugu film industry could have made a movie on that, but they didn't. May Because of lack of information or it possibly couldn't be a potential income generator or because of the lack of technicians who could do it. But the people of Srikakulam, if they could do a short movie on it, they could have done it. Even poverty in detail in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh can be shown by local artists way better than film industries. Tetseo sisters (they are not the internet generation, but they could be an inspiration) represented Nagaland culture on many occasions in national and international fests, primarily represented their naga culture and addressed some social issues.

* They would encourage traditional cultures, songs, and literature, as the traditional dance and music forms engage them. Not only that, if given a chance, they could even develop more and more engaging, just like the western art industries have developed.
