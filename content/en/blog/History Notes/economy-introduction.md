Management of Resources(both Natural and Artificial) by the Government in such a way that everyone( people in a state) should get food, shelter, water , transport , clothes etc is called Economics.

  
  

Study of resources is Economics, but combining it with an area(country or state) is called Economy.

  

*Example: Indian Economy, Germany Economy, Economy of Greenland etc*

  
  

Ragnar Frish coined the terms called Microeconomics and Macroeconomics.

  

Generally Economics is divided in two types

  

1.  Micro Economics(small scale, individual firms and Markets, consumer Behavior etc)
    
2.  Macro Economics(large scale, national income, unemployment, Inflation, GDP etc)
