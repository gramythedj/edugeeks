## Rise of the Mauryans and their Sources

  
  

4th century English writers like Justin, Strabo, Plutarch, and Arien Wrote about Military strength of the Mauryan Empire. It is stated that Mauryans had 1 lacks plus infantry, 9000 elephantry, 6000 cavalry, 8000 chariotry.

  
  

Parisistaparvan(12th cent AD) wrote about famine in Magadha and Sallekhana practices

  
  

Buddhist sources have been found from ceylon(Srilanka)

  

Lama Taranatha wrote history of Tibet(Buddhsist sources)

  

Megasthenes wrote Indica and added some controversial statements like

  

-   He said there was no slavary in India
    
-   There are no famines in India
    
-   There are seven castes in India
    
-   He saw some people who had 3 eyes(might have confused with tilak of Veerashaivaites) on the banks of Yamuna River
    

  
  

Epigraphy in India

  

First inscriptions in India(record writings on stones)- Ashoka

  

Ashokas inscriptions are called as EDICTS

  

He issued 3 types of edicts

  

1.  Rock Edicts (Major roks +Minor Rocks)
    
2.  Pillar Edicts
    
3.  Cave Edicts
    

  

Ashoka used the Prakruth Language (Jains used Prakruth while Pali was spoken by Buddhist) in the edicts while script written was Brahmi

  
  

Only in 2 places Ashoka used Greek and Aramic language and used Kharosthi script in north west India (Mansehra and Shahbaz Giri today Pakistan)

  

Brahmi script goes from Left to Right while in Kharosthi it goes from Right to Left

  
  

*Important*

  

In 1837 British Civil servant named James Prinsep finally decoded the 2500 year old Brahmi script and finally came to know about Ashoka Inscription and his Legacy

  
  

Themes in inscription

-   Ashoka as a king
    
-   Ashoka as a Buddhist
    

  
  

In all the inscriptions Ashoka's title is found but not the name of the Ashoka (Devanampiya and Piyadasi)

  

Only in four inscriptions ashoka's name is found in ( Maski, Nittur ,Gujjar and piklihal/Brahmagiri) inscriptions

  
  
  
  
  

### Major Rocks Edicts

  
  

13th MRE says the Ashoka realized after the Kalinga War and started practicing Dhamma

  

After killing 1 lakh people ,A five year old boy (Nigrotha) a Buddhist Monk came to Ashoka and insulted Ashoka and after that he realized and stated non violence and also stopped vihara yatra and no more Bherigosha(dance before war)

  
  

Dhamman sharanam gachhami and Buddham sharanam Gachhami and sangham saranam Gacchami found in Babbu minor rock(Bengal) Edict

  
  

HG Wells, he says that Ashoka is a moon in the Galaxy of stars

2.  Rummindei pillar Nepal(info about Taxes)
    
3.  Saranath pillar UP
    
4.  Lauriya Nandangarh Pillar Bihar
    

  

Note : on every pillar there's a carving of animal on pillar depicting the symbol of capital cities for example on Sarnath pillar we find 4 roaring lions

  
  

## Cave edicts

  

Ashoka issued 4 caves at BARABAR (Bihar) and gifted it to Ajivikas as a token of Secularism

  

Ashoka's grandson Dasharath also donated 4 caves to Ajivikas at Nagarjuni (Bihar)

  
  
  

## Numismatic Sources

  

Mouryans minted pure silver coins called karshapanas and also minted gold coins called Tola but they were not pure gold coins and historians rejected it.

  

Financial year started in Ashada Month.

  

Symbols on the coins were Peacock, Hills, Tree, Birds etc

3.  Ashoka (268-232 BC)
    

  
  
  

### Chandra Gupta Mourya (CGM)

  

Puranas says that he is a shudra as he did not adopted Brahmanism(just a theory), and Jains texts say that he is kshatriya because he adopted Jainism(another theory), there is no clarity on the birth of Chandra Gupta Mourya, some texts says that insulted by Nandas , Chanakya made an oath that he will raise a shudra and make him rule the entire India and he will be the reason for the downfall of mighty Nandas who were also shudras.
