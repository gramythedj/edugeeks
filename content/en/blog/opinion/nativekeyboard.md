The keyboard is the essential tool that rules the world directly and indirectly In many ways. We have keyboards to type anything, but all it has is English on them. This helps the English to have more and more non-native English speakers worldwide (at least in the non-European ethnicity). 


Indians, especially Hindi speakers, don't want to have English supremacy in their language. Many politicians take this for their political advantage, leaving politics aside deep down in the heart of people. Most people want to change this situation. But something occurred to me about this today, in the modern era, to stop the supremacy of English over India and use their mother tongues instead, there is a lot to do.


One of the essential things we don't notice is the Keyboard, which we type daily for texting, searching for a phone number, browsing the internet, watching a youtube video, typing codes, etc. We are using the English alphabet to type Hindi words (some people call this Hinglish); I have been shocked to see people using Hinglish in places where it can be replaced by real Hindi text. For example, "apna time ayega" which can be typed in Hindi, it's a Hindi sentence, but on the poster, it's written in English alphabets, similarly "ab raja ka beta raja nahi hoga, raja wahi hoga jo hakdaar hoga". 


I am not here to point fingers at Bollywood, it happens in many places, but as a South Indian, I noticed very few things that everyone could relate to for a Hindi speaker. 


The keyboard plays a vital role in the modern world and will play in the future, so to decrease the domination of English in India, one has to figure out how to type in the native languages. Of course, there are Hindi typing keyboards, Tamil typing keyboards, Bengali typing keyboards, and Telugu typing keyboards. Still, they are not optimistic about helping Indians with this issue. They would make it worse in many cases. Indian languages are not fit for making a keyboard. 


I believe there should be a new tool that could replace the English keyboard with a native language-oriented tool. Voice recognition tools come close but are not sophisticated enough, inaccurate, and less private. You could send a romantic msg to your lover without no one knowing. Still, with voice recognition, everyone around you will know what you are talking about. You could not use this feature in overly crowded areas as many people speaking might catch the words of others along with your voice. 

Another idea is the handwritten text that could convert into printed text tools. This could work, but this needs pens with which we could write on smartphones, computers etc. This idea has its own problem writing would be more difficult than typing. You could type in a running bus, but writing causes problems there. 

Is there any idea that could solve all our problems in this matter? Anyone in India needs to come up with an idea which could solve all the problems of a keyboard with modern tools with which we can enjoy all the comforts we are having with keyboard in the native languages.
