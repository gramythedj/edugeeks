One of the stupidest things in Indian schools is making students wear shoes. It becomes very gross under the feet, especially during exam seasons. India's hot and humid climate can cause excessive sweating, leading to skin irritation and fungal infections. In addition, the pungent smell of sweaty shoes and socks can be a source of discomfort for other students.

Moreover, footwear is not necessary for a school environment as there are no dangers of children getting hurt. The traditional purpose of wearing shoes was to protect the feet from getting hurt or injured during activities such as mountaineering, trekking, etc. These activities are not undertaken in schools; thus, wearing shoes becomes irrelevant. Although it could be acceptable when students are going for sports or for labs where there would be dangers of hurting the legs

In addition, shoes can be expensive, and some families may not be able to afford them. This could lead to discrimination among students and create an unequal learning environment. Moreover, some shoes may not be comfortable to wear and could lead to physical pain or injury. Some people argue that wearing shoes could help students avoid dirt and bacteria. I think washing legs would be a very good habit that would overcome that issue. (Although wearing the shoes needs ten times more cleaning than not wearing)
 In conclusion, we Indians don't need shoes in schools unless it is absolutely necessary. It is the stupid convent culture blindly following needs to be changed
