** $sin^2$ x + $cos^2$ x = 1**

**proof:**

Let us consider a triangle ABC as shown in the figure of side lengths a, b, c and X be the angle at vertex A and right angle at C. From this we can understand that side BC is opposite side to angle x and side AC is adjacent side and AB is the hypotenuse.

To prove the indentity let's consider the left hand side of the equation to evaluate that it is equal to the right hand side.

L.H.S:
= $sin^2$ x + $cos^2$ x

by definition sin x = $\frac{opposite side to angle x}{hypotenuse}$ and cos x = $\frac{adjacent side to angle x}{hypotenuse}$
