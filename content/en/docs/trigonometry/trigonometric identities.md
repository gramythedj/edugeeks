**1) $sin^2$ x + $cos^2$ x = 1**

**proof:**

To prove this identity let us use pythagoras theorem. consider a right angled triangle as shown in the figure. It is a triangle ABC with right angle at the vertex B and angle x at vertex C.

According to pythagoras theorem we can write

![triangle ABC](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2022/11/30/15/38/triangle-7627070_960_720.jpg)

$AB^2$ + $BC^2$ = $AC^2$

Divide with $AC^2$ on both sides.

$\frac{AB^2+BC^2}{AC^2}$ = 1

$\frac{AB^2}{AC^2}$ + $\frac{BC^2}{AC^2}$ = 1

by definition sin x = $\frac{opposite_ side_ to _ angle _ x}{hypotenuse}$ = $\frac{AB}{AC}$ and cos x = $\frac{adjacent _ side _ to _ angle _ x}{hypotenuse}$ = $\frac{CB}{AC}$

Therefore $sin^2$ x + $cos^2$ x = 1


**I) Practice problems**

1) If sin x = $\frac{4}{5}$ find the value of cos x provided x is acute angle.
2) find the value of $sin^2$ $50^0$ + $sin^2$ $40^0$
3) find th value of $sin^2$ $18^0$ + $sin^2$ $72^0$ + $sin^2$ $108^0$ + $sin^2$ $162^0$
