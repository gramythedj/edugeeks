**1) $sin^2$ x + $cos^2$ x = 1**

**proof:**

To prove this identity let us use pythagoras theorem. consider a right angled triangle as shown in the figure. It is a triangle ABC with right angle at the vertex B and angle x at vertex C.

According to pythagoras theorem we can write

$AB^2$ + $BC^2$ = $AC^2$

Divide with $AC^2$ on both sides.

$\frac{AB^2+BC^2}{AC^2}$ = 1

$\frac{AB^2}{AC^2}$ + $\frac{BC^2}{AC^2}$ = 1

by definition sin x = $\frac{opposite\ side\ to \ angle\ x}{hypotenuse}$ = $\frac{AB}{AC}$ and cos x = $\frac{adjacent \ side \ to\ angle \ x}{hypotenuse}$ = $\frac{CB}{AC}$

Therefore $sin^2$ x + $cos^2$ x = 1


**I) Practice problems**

1) If sin x = $\frac{4}{5}$ find the value of cos x provided x is acute angle.
2) find the value of $sin^2$ $50^0$ + $sin^2$ $40^0$
3) find th value of $sin^2$ $18^0$ + $sin^2$ $72^0$ + $sin^2$ $108^0$ + $sin^2$ $162^0$

**2) $sec^2$ x - $tan^2$ x =1**

**proof:**

To prove this identity let us use pythagoras theorem. consider a right angled triangle as shown in the figure. It is a triangle ABC with right angle at the vertex B and angle x at vertex C.

According to pythagoras theorem we can write

$AB^2$ + $BC^2$ = $AC^2$

Divide with $BC^2$ on both sides, so that we can get tan x and sec x functions in the equation.

$\frac{AB^2}{BC^2}$ + 1 = $\frac{AC^2}{BC^2}$

by definition tan x = $\frac{opposite\ side\ to\ angle\ x}{adjacent\ side\ to\ angle\ x}$ = $\frac{AB}{BC}$ and sec x = $\frac{hypotenuse}{adjacent\ side\ to\ angle\ x}$ = $\frac{AC}{BC}$

Therefore $tan^2$ x + 1 = $sec^2$ x 

**II) solve the following problem**

1) If sec A + tan A = 4, find the value of sin A.
2) Prove that $\frac{tan\ A+sec\ A -1}{tan\ A-sec\ A +1}$ = $\frac{1+sin\ A}{cos\ A}$

**3) $cosec^2$ x - $cot^2$ x =1**

**proof:**

To prove this identity let us use pythagoras theorem. consider a right angled triangle as shown in the figure. It is a triangle ABC with right angle at the vertex B and angle x at vertex C.

![triangle ABC](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2022/11/30/15/38/triangle-7627070_960_720.jpg)

According to pythagoras theorem we can write

$AB^2$ + $BC^2$ = $AC^2$

Divide with $AB^2$ on both sides, so that we can get tan x and sec x functions in the equation.

$\frac{BC^2}{AB^2}$ + 1 = $\frac{BC^2}{AC^2}$

by definition cot x = $\frac{adjacent\ side\ to\ angle\ x}{opposite\ side\ to\ angle\ x}$ = $\frac{BC}{AB}$ and cosec x = $\frac{hypotenuse}{opposite\ side\ to\ angle\ x}$ = $\frac{BC}{AC}$

Therefore  $cosec^2$ x - $cot^2$ x =1

**III) solve the following**

1) find the value of (sin x + cosec x) $^2$ + (cos x + sex x) $^2$ - (tan x + cot x) $^2$
2) If Cosex A + Cot A = $\frac{2}{3}$ find the value of Sin A
