Spin is a quantum mechanical property that describes the intrinsic angular momentum of a nucleus, while parity is a quantum number that describes 
the symmetry properties of a nucleus under reflection. The spin and parity of a nucleus play a crucial role in determining its physical and chemical 
properties and are used extensively in nuclear physics research.

### Spin:

The spin of a nucleus is a fundamental property that arises from the intrinsic angular momentum of its constituent particles, such as protons and 
neutrons. The spin of a nucleus is described using the quantum mechanical concept of angular momentum, which is a vector quantity that represents the 
rotation of an object around an axis. The magnitude of the angular momentum of a nucleus is proportional to its spin quantum number, denoted by the symbol I.

The spin quantum number can take on half-integer or integer values, depending on the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. For example, nuclei 
with an odd number of protons or neutrons have a half-integer spin, while nuclei with an even number of protons and neutrons have an integer spin. The spin 
quantum number is important in nuclear physics because it determines the magnetic moment of the nucleus, which is used in various experimental techniques, 
such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.

### Parity:

The parity of a nucleus is a quantum number that describes its symmetry properties under reflection. A nucleus can be either even or odd parity, depending 
on whether it is symmetric or asymmetric under reflection. Parity is described using the quantum mechanical concept of parity operator, denoted by the symbol 
P, which changes the sign of the wave function of a nucleus under reflection.

The parity of a nucleus is related to the number of nucleons with spin up and spin down. For example, if a nucleus has an even number of nucleons with spin 
up and an even number of nucleons with spin down, it has an even parity. Conversely, if a nucleus has an odd number of nucleons with spin up and an even number 
of nucleons with spin down, it has an odd parity.

let $\psi$ (x,y,z) be a wave function representing the particle

then if $\psi$ (-x,-y,-z) = $\psi$ (x,y,z) : even parity

and if $\psi$ (-x,-y,-z) = - $\psi$ (x,y,z) : odd parity
