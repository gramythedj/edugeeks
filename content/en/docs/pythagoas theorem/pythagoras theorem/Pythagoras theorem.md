### Proof of Pythagoras theorem

Statement: square of length hypotenuse of a right angled triangle is equal to the sum of squares of lengths other two sides

i.e. $c^2 = a^2+b^2$

Where **c** is the length of hypotenuse of a right angled triangle, while **a** and **b** are lengths of other two sides 

**Proof:**


Consider the triangle ABC where $\angle$ B = $90^0$ as shown in the figure. Let's draw BD line segment such that BD is perpendicular to side AC creating two right angled triangles BDA and BDC

###### Let’s compare \triangle ABC with $\triangle$ ABD

$\angle$ BAC = $\angle$ BAD

$\angle ABC$ = $\angle$ ADB = $90^0$

Therefore by Angle-Angle axiom we can say that $\triangle$ ABC $\sim$ $\triangle$ ADB

As  $\triangle$ ABC $\sim$ $\triangle$ ADB

$\frac{AB}{AD}=\frac{AC}{AB}$ 

AB $^2$ = AC AD   —---------(1)

###### Let’s compare \triangle ABC with $\triangle$ BDC

$\angle$ BCA = $\angle$ BCD

$\angle ABC$ = $\angle$ BDC = $90^0$

Therefore by Angle-Angle axiom we can say that $\triangle$ ABC $\sim$ $\triangle$ BDC

As  $\triangle$ ABC $\sim$ $\triangle$ BDC

$\frac{BC}{DC}=\frac{AC}{BC}$

BC $^2$ = DC AC  —---------(2)

From (1) and (2), Add (1) and (2)

AB $^2$ + BC $^2$ = AC AD + DC AC

AB $^2$ + BC $^2$ = AC ( AD + AC)

From the diagram we can see that AC = AD + AC

AB $^2$ + BC $^2$ = AC $^2$

Hence proved that in a right angled triangle square of length of hypotenuse is equal to the sum of squares of the lengths of other two sides.
