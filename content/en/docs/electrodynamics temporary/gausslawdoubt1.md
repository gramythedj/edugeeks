No, the differential form of Gauss's law only relates to the charge density inside the chosen Gaussian surface. It tells you about the divergence of the electric field at a specific point, which is directly linked to the charge density at that same point.

Here's why charges outside the surface don't come into play:

Local Property: The divergence is a local property. It calculates how much the field "flows outward" from an infinitesimal volume around that point. Charges outside this tiny volume wouldn't contribute to the divergence at that specific point.
Closed Surface: Gauss's Law in differential form applies to a specific point. We integrate this concept over a whole closed surface (Gaussian surface) to arrive at the integral form of Gauss's law. The integral form relates the total electric flux exiting the entire closed surface to the net charge enclosed by that surface. Charges outside the surface wouldn't contribute to the total flux exiting the surface either.
Therefore, the differential form of Gauss's law focuses solely on the relationship between the electric field behavior and the charge density within the chosen Gaussian surface. It doesn't directly account for charges residing outside that specific surface.

\section{If that is the case then why do we consider the Laplacian equation of potential which is derived from the Gauss law?}

You're right, there seems like a disconnect at first glance. Gauss's law in differential form deals with charges inside the Gaussian surface, while the Laplace equation for potential applies throughout space (not confined to a specific surface).

Here's how they connect:

Starting Point: Gauss's law (in its integral form) relates the total electric flux exiting a closed surface to the net enclosed charge. This integral form can be further manipulated using the divergence theorem, which relates the flux integral over a closed surface to the divergence of the vector field inside that surface.

From Integral to Differential:  Applying the divergence theorem to Gauss's law in the integral form gives us the differential form:

$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}$

Here, the divergence of the electric field directly relates to the charge density within the chosen Gaussian surface.

Electric Field and Potential: The electric field (E) is related to the electric potential (V) through the gradient:
E =−∇V (the negative gradient)

This equation essentially states that the electric field points in the direction of the steepest decrease in potential.

Laplace Equation and Potential: Now, if there are no net charges within a region (meaning the charge density, ρ, is zero in that region), then according to Gauss's law (differential form), the divergence of the electric field (∇ ·  
E ) must also be zero.
Taking the divergence of both sides of the equation  
E=−∇V, we get:

∇ · (-\nabla V) = 0

This manipulation leads to the Laplace equation for potential in that region:

∇²V = 0 (where ∇² is the Laplacian operator, representing the divergence of the gradient)

So, the Laplace equation applies when there are no net charges within a specific region. It essentially states that in such regions, the "total outward flow" of the gradient of the potential (which is related to the electric field) is zero at every point.

In summary:

Gauss's law (differential form) helps us understand the relationship between the electric field's divergence and the charge density within a chosen Gaussian surface.
The Laplace equation applies throughout a region with no net charges and governs the behavior of the electric potential in that region.
They are connected because the absence of net charges (which Gauss's law addresses) leads to the specific condition (∇²V = 0) that the Laplace equation for potential needs to satisfy.
