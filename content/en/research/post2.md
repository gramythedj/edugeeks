# Study Reveals that in Graphene Electrons Become Fractions of Themselves

*Date: 25-02-2024*

## Introduction

Prepare to be astonished as we dive into the dazzling world of quantum physics, where electrons – those tiny titans of electricity – have just pulled off an unexpected trick. In a groundbreaking study at MIT, researchers have unveiled a mind-bending phenomenon: electrons in graphene, the superhero material of the scientific world, are breaking into fractions of themselves. Buckle up for a quantum journey that defies the ordinary and promises a quantum leap for future technologies!

## The Electrifying Show: Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect

Picture this: electrons, those familiar carriers of electrical charge, decide to ditch convention and split into fractions of their own charge. This mesmerizing dance, known as the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect, was once thought to be achievable only under the influence of intense magnetic fields. But hold on to your hats – MIT physicists have discovered that graphene, yes, the same material from your pencil lead, can make electrons pull off this electrifying stunt without the need for any external magnetic field.

## Graphene's Surprising Performance

In the quantum theater, graphene takes center stage and delivers an unexpected plot twist. Typically, we've marveled at graphene's thinness and exceptional conductivity, but now it's showcasing a hidden talent. When five layers of graphene are stacked like a staircase, the stage is set for electrons to break free from their usual routine and exhibit fractional charge. No strings attached, no magnetic field required – just pure, unadulterated quantum magic.

## The Pentalayer Graphene Spectacle

Enter the protagonist: pentalayer graphene, a five-layered wonder that defies expectations. Chilled to ultracold temperatures, this material slows down its electrons, creating an environment where quantum interactions take center stage. Aligning pentalayer graphene with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) produces a mesmerizing moiré superlattice, a scaffold-like structure that mimics the effects of a magnetic field without the actual need for one. It's a quantum ballet where electrons pirouette in fractions, leaving scientists in awe.

## The Unexpected Encore

In a twist of fate, the MIT researchers stumbled upon signs of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect while exploring graphene. This material, known for its versatility, revealed a side that physicists hadn't predicted. The team's calculations and experiments confirmed that the pentalayer graphene structure indeed exhibited fractional charge, marking the first time this effect has been observed in graphene. Cue the applause for this unexpected encore in the world of quantum physics!

## Graphene's Quantum Computing Capabilities

Now, let's talk about the implications. This quantum spectacle isn't just for show; it's laying the groundwork for the future of computing. Traditional quantum computers face challenges in maintaining stability, but graphene's ability to induce fractional charge opens the door to building more robust and fault-tolerant quantum computers. Imagine a quantum computer that shrugs off perturbations and performs with resilience – that's the promise that graphene holds in its quantum arsenal.

## Conclusion: Quantum Marvels Unveiled

As we wrap up our quantum journey through the realms of graphene, it's clear that we've witnessed a scientific spectacle that challenges our understanding of the fundamental building blocks of matter. The fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in graphene adds a dazzling chapter to the story of quantum physics, where the ordinary becomes extraordinary.

The tale of graphene's unexpected quantum prowess is far from over. MIT researchers, armed with pentalayer graphene and a thirst for discovery, are diving deeper into the quantum sea, exploring the material's electronic behaviors for more surprises and breakthroughs. In this quantum saga, where the extraordinary is the norm, the next act promises even more astonishing revelations. Stay tuned for the unfolding quantum marvels that graphene has yet to unveil!
